### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Adding new features**

### Adding a new command

To add a new command, here are two key things to note.

* Ensure your new command and it's associated parser is added to `CommandRegistry.java`
* Ensure your new command class has the public static variables `COMMAND_WORD`, `MESSAGE_USAGE`, `PARAMETERS`, and `EXAMPLE` are declared.

Doing so ensures that the app's HelpWindow will be automatically populated with your newly added command's information. Having the `COMMAND_WORD` declared also ensures that the new command will be added into the `AddressBookParser.java`, meaning your command will be usable! No need to modify any other files or switch cases.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of players and their player details, statistics, roles, and availability
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage team operations and analyze player data (statistics, roles, availability) faster and more efficiently than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

4.  Data should be automatically saved to JSON files after every modifying command (add, delete, edit, result, stats).
5.  No data loss should occur if the application crashes unexpectedly (data should be saved before each command completes).
6.  The application should validate all input data before saving (phone/email format, rank validity, role types).
7.  The application should not crash if provided with invalid commands; instead, it should display appropriate error messages.
8.  New commands can be added by creating command and parser classes and registering them in CommandRegistry without modifying existing command handling logic.
9. Should support up to 50 different entities/champions per player without performance degradation.
10. Should support up to 100 tags per player without performance degradation.
11. Should maintain a match history of up to 500 matches without affecting application performance.


### Glossary

* **IGN**: In-Game Name, a player's username in the game
* **Entity**: An umbrella term for a character that the player plays in the game. In League of Legends, this refers to a 'Champion'. In other games, this may refer to an 'Agent', 'Operator', 'Hero', or whatever term that particular game uses.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Key Achievements
**Data Model Expansion**
- Implemented multi-entity statistics tracking where each player can have performance data across multiple game characters
- Added 15+ new model classes across entity/, match/, and person/statistics/ packages

**Command Architecture Enhancement**
- Added 5 new commands: `compare`, `draft`, `filter`, `stats`, `result` with complex parsing logic
- Implemented CommandRegistry mechanism, making adding new Commands easier. (No need to manually add new commands to a switch case.)

**Game-Agnostic Entity System**
- The default EntityReference used for input validation is League Of Legends based. However, the app is able to load custom `entities.json` files to change this validation. Thus, the app is able to be adapted by an advanced user to support a different esports games. The dynamic loading of images, as well as the fallback tooltip mechanisms further support this. 

### Effort Required (High level overview)

**Model Layer**: 15+ new classes including Entity, EntityStatisticMap, Match, MatchRecord, Result, PlayerInMatch, and supporting statistics classes (Kills, Deaths, Assists)

**Logic Layer**: 5 new command classes (CompareCommand, DraftCommand, FilterCommand, StatsCommand, ResultCommand), corrseponding parsers, and other various utilities to support these classes.

**Storage Layer**: 10+ new JSON adapters (JsonAdaptedEntity, JsonAdaptedEntityPathPair, JsonAdaptedEntityStatisticMap, JsonAdaptedMatch, JsonAdaptedPlayerInMatch, JsonAdaptedStatistics, etc.) and full integration into StorageManager

**UI Layer**: 3 new UI components for the Compare, Draft, and Help commands.

### Challenges Faced

**Statistics Aggregation**: Designing efficient statistics tracking and display across multiple entities per player, with cumulative updates and overall performance calculation

**Game-Agnostic Design**: Creating an extensible entity system that allows easy game switching while maintaining data integrity and validation.

**UI Integration**: Displaying complex statistics data (multiple entities per player) in a clean, user-friendly interface without overwhelming the user.

### Reuse and it's impact

- CommandRegistry idea taken from IP, albeit modified to fit the AB3's implementation of separate Parser and Command classes
- AB3 architecture and project scaffold for implementation of new commands, allowed for easy parsing of complex arguments, reducing setup and boilerplate effort.
